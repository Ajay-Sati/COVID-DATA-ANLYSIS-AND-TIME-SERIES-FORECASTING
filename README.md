# CCOVID DATA ANALYSIS  AND FORECASTING
In this project ,COVID Data Analysis project,  an extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to extract valuable insights from pandemic data. The analysis focused on various aspects, including confirmed cases, active cases, recovered cases, and unfortunately, deceased cases.

To enhance the understanding of the geographical spread, map visuals were incorporated to provide a detailed view of how the pandemic unfolded across different regions. This visual representation aids in identifying hotspots and variations in the impact of the virus.

In addition to EDA, the project ventured into predicting the next 14 days using advanced forecasting models such as ARIMA, SARIMAX, and FB Prophet. These models leverage time series data to provide forecasts, offering valuable insights into potential trends and helping in proactive decision-making.

The combination of detailed exploratory analysis and sophisticated forecasting techniques makes this COVID Data Analysis project a valuable resource for understanding the dynamics of the pandemic. From deriving insights on various case categories to predicting future trends, this project contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the ongoing global health crisis.
